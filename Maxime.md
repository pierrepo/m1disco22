# Maxime
Hey I'm Maxime from France, Europe 🇪🇺

I have a licence in **literature** (French, Latin, Italian and English) and a Master Degree in **geopolitics**.

I'm doing an internship at **AirFrance** ✈️

And I looooove music, all kind of music !
- Sade
- All kind of electronic music
- Jazz etc.

Please [keep track](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yxYZUc3EF3g-xxgUWgwsrcvGWR4kpmhlm8cFWA6doQU/edit#gid=0) of our progress :)
Mark it as `Done` when you are !

```python 
#fenced code
for color in mypalette:
    print(color)
```
And I have to say that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i \pi} = -1">
