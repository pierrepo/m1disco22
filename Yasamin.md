## **Yasi**

I'm from Iran. I'm an M1 digital science at Universite de Paris. I love programming and data analysis. 

My favorite singer is *[Mohammadreza Shajarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad-Reza_Shajarian)*, who is an Iranian singer. 
And the important thing is that Nowruz is coming in two days. Nowruz is Persian new year and it starts exactly at the time that we enter the **SPRING**. So Happy New Year! :evergreen_tree:
And this is my code:
```python 
#fenced code
for i < 2:
    print('Happy Nowruz')
```
And please take a look at that. It is important!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
